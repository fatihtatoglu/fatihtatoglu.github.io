# Brand Rules

## Brand Identity: **Fatih Tatoğlu**

### 🧭 Brand Overview

Fatih Tatoğlu is an engineer and writer who values **clarity, curiosity, discipline, and authenticity**.  
His blog serves as a space to **share experience, reflect on lessons learned, and inspire awareness** through honest storytelling and technical insight.  

> Motto: *“Life goes on, you just have to grab one end of it.”*

The brand is not about selling or self-promotion — it is about **teaching, reflecting, and connecting with genuine curiosity**.  
The reader should feel that every article is written by someone who *deeply understands the system yet explains it simply.*

## 🎯 Vision & Goals

- **Main Purpose:** To express ideas, share experiences, and inspire awareness.  
- **Impact Goal:** Readers should leave with a thought like *“I learned something new”* or *“This made me think differently.”*  
- **Long-term Vision:** To become a respected voice in engineering and thoughtful writing — someone known for clarity and insight.  

## 🗣️ Tone of Voice

| Attribute | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Conversational** | Write as if speaking to a thoughtful peer; natural, not robotic. |
| **Balanced** | Combine approachable tone with technical depth when needed. |
| **Authentic** | Avoid exaggeration, clichés, or artificial “sales” tone. |
| **Respectful** | Address the reader directly (“you” or “reader”) when it feels natural, otherwise use neutral tone. |
| **Curious & Reflective** | Encourage discovery and critical thinking. |
| **Disciplined & Precise** | Structure thoughts logically and support arguments clearly. |

**Do NOT use:**

- Pushy marketing language  
- Overly academic jargon  
- Empty motivational clichés  

## 💡 Emotional Values

Writing should express:

- **Curiosity** – ignite the reader’s desire to explore further  
- **Trust** – convey reliability and thoughtfulness  
- **Discipline** – show structured thinking and focus  

Every piece should feel **humble, confident, and precise** — not showy or overcomplicated.

## 🎨 Visual & Stylistic Preferences

- **Style:** Clean, minimal, retro-technical (inspired by console UI aesthetics).  
- **Color palette:** Soft, natural, non-distracting colors.  
- **Typography:** Monospaced or semi-monospaced for a developer vibe.  
- **Imagery:** Minimal and functional — used only when it supports understanding.  

## 🧱 Content Structure & Format

### 🗂 Main Categories

1. **Technical Notes**  
   - Tutorials, walkthroughs, or development insights.  
   - Focus on fundamentals and simplification.  
   - Use clear structure, headers, and examples.  
   - Objective, concise, and educational.  
   - Target reader: developers, engineers, technical peers.

2. **Life & Learning**  
   - Reflections, personal insights, stories, or essays.  
   - More emotional and philosophical in tone.  
   - Still disciplined, but open to storytelling and metaphor.  
   - Target reader: anyone interested in growth and awareness.

### 📏 Length Expectations
