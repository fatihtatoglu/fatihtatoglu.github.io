Facilitator, Change Agent, Impediment Remover, etc. After that, while taking a management lecture, I realized the same competencies must be on the management side.</p><p>You will see all or some of these roles in your working life. You will even have to take on some of these roles. But there is nothing to be afraid of it. You can learn all of these roles. There are so many books on the dos and don&#39;ts of these roles. Maybe, this article is one of those sources of information. It is up to you.</p><h2>Hats</h2><p>I associate the roles with hats. While choosing a hat, you select best-fit. If it is not suitable for you, it won&#39;t look nice and will be uncomfortable. But this time, all of them are fit for you and look very nice. You only have to decide which one to wear and where.</p><p>Let&#39;s take a look at the hats we have and the roles they symbolize.</p><h3>Teacher</h3><p>A teacher is a person who teaches a subject to the people who want to have an education. The responsibility of the teacher is over after the lecture. In other words, it is not concerned with whether the students who receive education apply what they have learned or not. However, a teacher can take the test or give homework to control the subject&#39;s understanding correctly.</p><p>Teachers prepare documents and presentations that use during lectures. These documents are created by combining research and experience.</p><p>Teachers teach to rather than one person, multiple people.</p><h3>Consultant</h3><p>A consultant is a person who specializes in a subject with their work and experience. In case of need, someone is consulted.</p><p>Consultants support clients in the problems encountered based on their experiences.</p><p>Consultants want to make sure that the issue they are supporting ends up in the way clients want.</p><h3>Coach</h3><p>A coach helps you while walking to the target you set, unleashes your potential, and increases your level of awareness. While providing support, it determines a private study and support program for you instead of using previous experiences or expertise.</p><p>The most important properties of the coaches are listening carefully, asking powerful questions for understanding the actual needs, and creating awareness for you to find proper solutions.</p><h3>Mentor</h3><p>I think the mentor is one of the roles that we play it. Mentor; are people who guide people with their experience, knowledge, or expertise, give advice, set goals and walk with people on their way to that goal.</p><p>A mentor is a role that progresses based on more experience. Although individual work is being done, it may be advancing the same goal for other people.</p><h3>Facitilator</h3><p>The facilitator is the person who makes it easier for the client to reach their goal. It can be the person who can take the necessary steps to help the client meet their target easily or only show the quick ways.</p><p>It does not have to work with the client. It can observe separately and take its actions independently.</p><h3>Impediment Remover</h3><p>An impediment remover is a person who senses possible impediments and supports to remove the blockage in the front of the client. While removing the blockages, they use communication and human relationship skills.</p><p>Without any client action, they could remove the blockages.</p><h3>Manager</h3><p>Managers are who hold in their hands the power of the management to manage a team or a process. They make decisions and sometimes take risks to ensure that the process or team works and achieves goals parallel to the institution.</p><p>In addition to his knowledge and experience, the manager should be very good at communication and human relations. It periodically monitors the people it manages and ensures or takes action according to the situation.</p><h3>Listener</h3><p>The listeners may sound like it&#39;s not a full role, but you may have experienced this scene. You feel uncomfortable and only want to share your feeling with someone. The people don&#39;t say anything to you and only listen. They also show you that they are listening, but in the end, they don&#39;t take any action or do not guide you to tacking any action. I called this role the listener.</p><p>In my opinion, this role must exist in companies and working life.</p><p>There will be different roles or hats that you could observe in working life. If you want, you can share these roles with me.</p><h2>How to wear the hats?</h2><p>I saw the roles and the responsibilities crossed together in working life. Because of this, I did mentoring or managing rather than wanted to do coaching and teaching. So I had to wear multiple hats at the same time. However, I could continue with a hat.</p><p>During peak times, you need to wear many hats at a time. In this case, the responsibilities will overlap. The solution might be to create a balance between roles or hats and wear hats in order. As <strong>Coach</strong>, after deepening the topics and allowing the need to be understood, it is possible to switch to other hats according to the client&#39;s needs.</p><p>The knowledge and necessary techniques are different for every role. <strong>Coach</strong> guides you to find your way, <strong>Mentor</strong> supports you in walking on your path together. <strong>Consultant</strong> solves your problem fastly, <strong>Teacher</strong> tries to teach you new knowledge.</p><h2>Client Effect</h2><p>We got in the role and wore the hat, but there is an unforgettable actor called client. Without a client, we can get any roles whatever we want. However, this will be meaningless.</p><p>These hats that we wear or will wear appear from a need. The needs of the person or client... Therefore, while wearing those hats, what the client needs is more important than whatever we want to do or which hat we want to wear. The effect of the wrong hat may cause unpredictable loss of motivation, emotional changes, or incorrect work. For preventing big problems, the client&#39;s needs must be understood correctly.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter which hat you wear at the end of the day. The given feedback has a similar result to how are your clients happy. This result will interpret as your success. That&#39;s why, instead of the hat that suits you best, take care to wear the hat that the client of you needs.</p><h2>References</h2><ol><li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/tr-tr/fotograf/rafta-karisik-renkli-kapak-lotu-396777/" title="Photo of the Post" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photo of the Post</a></li></ol><footer>By <a href="en/about-me.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fatih Tatoğlu</a> - <time pubdate datetime="2022-04-07T00:00:00+0000" title="04&#x2F;07&#x2F;2022">04&#x2F;07&#x2F;2022</time></footer></article></main><footer><span class="credits">Fatih Tatoğlu &copy; 1985</span></footer><div id="pnlSettingDialog" class="dialog"><div class="dialog-box"><div class="dialog-content"><header><span>Theme Options</span></header><main><table style="margin: auto;"><thead><th style="width: 150px;">Colors</th><th style="width: 150px">Languages</th></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;"><input id="rbColoraqua" name="color" type="radio" value="aqua"> <label for="rbColoraqua">Aqua</label><br><input id="rbColorblack" name="color" type="radio" value="black"> <label for="rbColorblack">Black</label><br><input id="rbColorblue" name="color" type="radio" value="blue"> <label for="rbColorblue">Blue</label><br><input id="rbColorwhite" name="color" type="radio" value="white"> <label for="rbColorwhite">White</label></td><td style="text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;"><input id="rbLangTR" name="lang" type="radio" value="tr" data-culture="tr-TR"> <label for="rbLangTR">Türkçe</label><br><input id="rbLangEN" name="lang" type="radio" value="en" data-culture="en-US"> <label for="rbLangEN">English</label></td></tr></tbody></table><br></main><footer><button id="btnSettingDialogOK" class="default" accesskey="o"><u>O</u>K</button></footer></div></div></div></body></html>
