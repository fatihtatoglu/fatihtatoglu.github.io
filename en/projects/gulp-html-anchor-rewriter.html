So I developed a gulp plugin for myself. With this plugin, it is possible to add <strong>rel</strong> and <strong>target</strong> to <strong>a</strong> elements in an HTML file.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>While developing Enginær, an issue related to SEO never crossed my mind. When using it on my site, I remember how important SEO is. I found a gulp plugin and created the sitemap.xml file. I made link adjustments by customizing Enginær&#39;s templates, but in the end, I determined that outgoing links from the site were not <strong>rel</strong> links, and I needed to add the <strong>target</strong> feature to prevent these links opened inside of the side. But I couldn&#39;t find a plugin that does this.</p><p>When I couldn&#39;t find the plugin I was looking for, a voice in my mind told me it might be fun to develop it myself. This time I wanted to follow this voice and start developing. My goal is to add <strong>rel</strong> and <strong>target</strong> attributes to some <strong>a</strong> elements in an HTML file.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p><img src="image/gulp-html-anchor-rewriter_tech.png" alt="NodeJS, Mocha, Chai, GitHub Actions, SonarCloud" title="Technologies used for the project"></p><p>I had only experience developing gulp plugins with Enginær before. Since this project will be a little easier, I thought I should make a challenge for myself and started researching how to write a gulp plugin. I found helpful documentation on Gulp&#39;s GitHub. I realized that I could write a great plugin by following this document.</p><p>It was stated in the document that the plugins might test. I kept on because this was a new challenge for me that I&#39;ve never written a unit test for either NodeJS or JavaScript. I found the <strong>Mocha</strong> and <strong>Chai</strong> libraries in my research, and after researching them a bit, I decided that they were so easy and continued. I&#39;ve developed the plugin and made a few improvements. After that, I wondered about the code coverage ratio of the project as in the others I added unit tests. I achieved this with <strong>IstanbulJS</strong>.</p><p>I decided that I should make one more addition after the project was simple and progressed quickly. Since I finished the project, I thought it would be informational to add a CI/CD structure and an integrated static code analysis to it. I chose <strong>SonarCloud</strong> for the project since <strong>SonarQube</strong> was the first thing that came to mind when I said static code analysis. When the pipeline I created with <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> was automatically integrated into <strong>SonarCloud</strong>, I got it done at lightning speed.</p><p>After a few scans, I saw that the calculated code coverage ratios ​​were not flowing to <strong>SonarCloud</strong>. After some research, I solved this problem with manual processing from <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> instead of automatic.</p><p>Finally, I started with a rare need, but what I learned and the experience I gained is precious. I will continue to do projects like this and push myself.</p><p>I published the project under the license of <a href="https://github.com/fatihtatoglu/gulp-html-anchor-rewriter/blob/master/LICENSE," title="MIT License of the Project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT</a> for everyone to use.
