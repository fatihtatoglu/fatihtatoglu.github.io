# About Me

Hello, this is Fatih Tatoğlu. I assume I cannot write anything about myself, but I believe that life is going forward passing some milestones. Here are the main milestones that created me, the version of me I am now;

- **1.0**: I was born in 1985, İstanbul
- **2.0**: I started high school in 1999 at **Haydarpaşa Anatolian Technical High School** in the section of Machinery in German.
  - **2.1**: Between 2000 and 2002, I met the programming with a computer magazine that gave a booklet about the C programming language.
  - **2.2**: During the same years, I learned I could program the PIC with the C programming language.
- **3.0**: I started university in 2003 at **Bahçeşehir University** with a major in Computer Engineering. I met C++.
  - **3.1**: During my first intern period in 2004, I did an internship at the **Istanbul Chamber of Industry**. The company created an opportunity to meet C# and Netron whom I would work for a long time.
  - **3.2**: During the university, I met the following programming languages. Assembly, Java, PHP, Perl, Verilog HDL.
  - **3.3**: I've met Linux Operation System.
  - **3.4**: Thanks to a friend, I had an opportunity to try *Linux from scratch*.
- **4.0**: I started to work at **Netron** in 2006.
- **5.0**: I graduated from university in 2008. The same year, I started my master's degree.
- **6.0**: With the courage that I could say was a craziness, two friends and I founded a company called **C34 Consult Istanbul**.
  - **6.1**: I left C34.
  - **6.2**: I completed my military service in 2011.
- **7.0**: I married in 2016.

Those are only my major and minor version upgrades of my milestones. However, I have many stories about my experiences and mostly my failures. As a result, I want to say,

> Hayat devam ediyor, bir ucundan tutmak lazım...

This means, that life goes on, you have to involve yourself somehow. I hope you can realize your milestones in your life.
