# About Me

Hello, I am Fatih Tatoğlu. I am a curious developer. I believe that life progresses by passing some milestones for everyone. We just need to recognize our milestones.

My milestones are;

- I live in İstanbul, Turkey.
- I studied computer engineering at Bahçeşehir University.
- I started programming as a hobby, but after my first internship it became my profession.
- I have a wonderful wife.
- I like to go SCUBA diving and ask curious questions.

To contact me, you can send a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatihtatoglu/ "Fatih Tatoğlu | LinkedIn"). You can follow my project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/fatihtatoglu/ "fatihtatoglu (Fatih Tatoğlu)") account.

## Why am I just a developer?

In my business life, I have developed much software and processes. While I have developed software, I have realized that I have also developed team members and people. In addition, I have also developed myself. So I can say "I am a developer".
