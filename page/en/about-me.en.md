Hello, I am Fatih. I prefer to describe myself as a curious developer. My life has been shaped by asking everything as a child and trying to find the answers to these questions. I motivate myself by saying "Never stop learning and trying!".

To make a long story short, below is some information about me.

- I live in Istanbul, Turkey.
- I graduated from Haydarpaşa Anatolian Technical High School Mechanical Department.
- I graduated from Bahçeşehir University Computer Engineering.
- I started programming as a hobby, but after my first internship, it turned into my job.
- I have a wonderful wife who is by my side for most of the good things in my life.
- I was interested in swimming and scuba diving.
