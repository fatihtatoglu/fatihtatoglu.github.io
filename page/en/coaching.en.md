I think that being interested in **Psychology**, **Sociology**, and of course **Biology** will make our lives easier, help us make sense of our behaviors, and enable us to interact with other individuals more easily. I can support this with the observations and individual experiments I have made so far.

In this section, I will share the experiences and awareness I have gained by coaching my teammates, reading books, and following some content about coaching and management. It would be unfair to my fellow coaches to consider myself an expert in coaching. However, I think that my awareness and experiences will be an opportunity to give a different perspective to new coaches or managers.
