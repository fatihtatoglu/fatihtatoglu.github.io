![Fatih Tatoğlu](../../image/about_me.jpg)

Hello, I am Fatih. It all started with my curiosity. When I was a child, I used to ask myself the following questions: ***"How does it work?"***, ***"Why does it rain?"***, etc. These questions and pursuit of answers have shaped my life. I like to learn new things, and to ask curios questions.

On this website, I would like to share my experience, my worries, my projects, and my questions. There are a lot of topic to write about. However, I prefer to follow my thinking path in my head when writing. In other words, the articles will be sometimes chaotic, sometimes simple and sometimes empirical...

I hope you will enjoy and learn new things reading it.
