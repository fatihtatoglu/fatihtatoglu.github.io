![Fatih Tatoğlu](../../image/about_me.jpg)

Hello, this is Fatih Tatoğlu. Everything has been started with my curiosity. My family says I was an inquisitive boy that asked similar questions such as, "How do they do this?", "How does it work?". I've prepared this website to share my learned and interesting subjects. In addition, I'll share my experiments' results and sources which are followed by me.

I've developed both theme of the website and the publishing system. My posts about this topic, you can find under the **Projects** menu. Under the **Coaching** menu, there are my observations (I am not an expert) about sociological and psychological posts and my analysis. I mostly write about business life, management and teamwork. **My Notes** section mostly contains notes about myself that are technical and increase my motivation. However, there is no limitation, I write what I want.

The website seems like my mind. I wish you good reading in advance.
