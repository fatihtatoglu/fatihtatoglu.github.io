Ever since I realized that learning something theoretically is not for me, I have been doing a lot of experiments on my computer, some of them based on problems that I need to solve, but others just to test the correctness of some strange idea. In this section I will share the technical work I have done, what I have learned, and my recipes. I will try to share all the instructions on how to prepare, repeat, and interpret the results of these experiments, which are purely technical.
