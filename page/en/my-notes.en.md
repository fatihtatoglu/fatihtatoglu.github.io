So far, I have found that I try to memorize all the information about development, research, the business processes of the companies I work for, and my readings. Sometimes, I have to admit that this is good. But memorizing, finding, processing, and generating new information is a tiring mental process. If I do this for a long time, I think it will be detrimental to my mental health. I think it is useful to clear the mind, to keep it clear, and to create an entry point that I will use in the future to find the necessary information.

You will find my notes, guidelines, and information entry points in this section for this purpose.
