# My Notes

![My Notes](../../image/notes.jpg)

So far, I have found that I try to memorize all information about development, research, the company's business processes which I am working for, and my readings. Sometimes that was a good thing. But memorizing, finding, processing, and generating new information is an exhausting mental process. If I do it for a long time, it can be detrimental to my mental health. It's helpful to clear the mind, keep it clean, and create an entry point that finds needed information.

This section contains my notes, my guidelines, and my entry points([Photo Source](https://www.pexels.com/tr-tr/fotograf/yapiskan-not-lot-1629212/)).
