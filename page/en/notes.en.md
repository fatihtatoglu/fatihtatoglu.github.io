# My Notes

![My Notes](../../image/notes.jpg)

The tools I used while developing, the technologies or concepts I used, the difficulties I faced, the correct and incomplete solutions I found to them, and the subjects I researched. I've realized that I try to keep all of these notes in my mind, in notebooks, and on my computer as small note files. While I'm trying to work efficiently, I've started writing some articles called "Notes to Myself" to escape my unproductive behavior.

All of the "Notes to Myself" articles will be private enough that can say that I did it because of those reasons, simple enough to give a start to the readers, and helpful enough to guide the steps of the process ([Photo Source](https://www.pexels.com/tr-tr/fotograf/yapiskan-not-lot-1629212/)).

I wish you good reading.
