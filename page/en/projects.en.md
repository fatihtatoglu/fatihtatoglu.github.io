The section's name is quite clear. But I still want to write something about it.

During my software development career, I developed corporate and personal projects. I faced many weird decisions and conversations. Naturally, I cannot share those. However, I can share my experiences and scenarios about them. By sharing some use cases, I aim to give a different view to my readers while deciding on their projects. Also, I plan to add posts about the technical side of my business life to this section, such as failed stories, confessions, and my design ideas about some specific problems.

Additionally, I have some open-source projects. Like every open-source project, my projects need your support. You can do that by giving a star to my projects or sharing your ideas.
