# Projects

![Projects](../../image/projects.jpg)

Actually, the title of the section expresses itself clearly. So far I have developed open source and personal projects. I would like to share these projects and the idea behind them with you ([Photo Source](https://www.pexels.com/tr-tr/fotograf/tilt-shift-lens-uzerindeki-kodlar-2004161/)).

Like all open source projects, these need your support. If there is a project you are interested in, you can star it or create an issue for bugs and new features.
