# Turbo C/C++ Theme

![Turbo C/C++](../image/turboc_0001.png "Turbo C/C++")

When I started programming, there was only Turbo C/C++ that I could use. In this article, I would like to share you to a website theme that is based on Turbo C/C++.

## Motivation

When I went to high school, the Internet was so new to me. I had a computer without internet. I only had the opportunity to use the Internet in an Internet café. To learn about computers, there were some computer magazines. One day, a magazine gave me a black booklet. The title of the booklet said "C Programming Language", and my curiosity was swung into action. I read through the booklet as fast as possible, but I felt that there was something missing from this experience. I had to try it out. On the Internet, I found the Turbo C/C++ compiler with some additional notes created by a Turkish hacker group.

The above story is also my first step to start programming. Then, once I started programming, I could not stop.

I like Turbo C/C++ because it gave me the opportunity to make something with my own hands. So I want to program a website theme based on Turbo C/C++.

## Challenges

In my opinion, the noticeable challenge is to create a similar user interface in a web application for users who have previously worked with Turbo C/C++, because the user interfaces of web applications and desktop applications are completely different. To achieve this, I need to make users feel the same when using them.

Another challenge is adding different colors and responsive design features to the theme. With HTML5 and CSS3 it can be coded, but adding SASS makes the theme more adaptable.

## Support

I've developed the theme for myself, but I shared it to be accessible to everyone under the [MIT](https://github.com/fatihtatoglu/blog-theme-turboc/blob/master/LICENSE "MIT License of the Project") license. To use, you can visit the project's [GitHub](https://github.com/fatihtatoglu/blog-theme-turboc "GitHub Address of the Project") repositories.
