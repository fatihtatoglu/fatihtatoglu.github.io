# Writing Blog

Sharing my ideas, productions, or learnings is one of the wishes that I make in my daily life, but  I could not ensure to be sustainable while doing it on the internet.

I have a lot of start-up stories about blogging. Each time, I start with the motivation ***" I will continue this time"***. I choose a beautiful theme. I find beautiful images. I research and understand the topics that I think are interesting, then write and share them in my own words. Next...

I told my wife about this situation. She said *"you like to start, but you don't continue..."*. Speaking at a meeting which I attended in 2020, [Selçuk Erdem](https://twitter.com/selcukerdem "Selçuk Erdem (@selcukerdem) / Twitter") also said, *"... don't let the notebook and pen you write or draw on the judge you... "*. When I thought about all this, I considered that the tools I used for writing and the images I chose were always powerful, and they were always judging me.

> If you were writing a post with these tools, it must be great.
>
> The visual you choose should be so impressive that the reader should be amazed.
>
> Your articles should tell us about us.
>
> Everyone should like your posts. Or what will my family say?

I say the above criticisms to myself. In different words, a voice repeated these sentences in my head. I want to revise my articles seven or eight times to think about those ideas. After pushing myself and loading myself, I cannot find any motivation to continue writing because there is not enough reading count.

> Others are posting weekly. I can't compete with them...

My goal is not to compete. I want to share and enjoy it. That's why I wrote this post. If my motivation decreases, I will want to remember and keep on writing after reading this article. To support my aim, I leave the image below where [Selçuk Erdem](https://twitter.com/selcukerdem "Selçuk Erdem (@selcukerdem) / Twitter") had a caricature drawn by someone like me who has no understanding of drawing.
