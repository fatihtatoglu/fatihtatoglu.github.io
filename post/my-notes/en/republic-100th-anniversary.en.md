Yes, today is the birthday of the modern Türkiye. A hundred years ago, you were born through Atatürk and his comrades-in-arms. We owe a lot to you. I don't want to explain how the Turkish Republic was built because I have to apologize to you.

I can write this message to you and everyone through your effort, which acts while building the republic. Unless you didn't exist, the modern Türkiye couldn't exist. However, we're not able to take care of it. We have left the path to the contemporary civilizations that you opened for us. We are struggling with daily bullshits and trying to survive.

![We built the republic, you are the ones who will make it live forever.](../../../image/blog-100th-republic-ataturks-quote.png "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk")

We owe a lot to your father, because he warned us, and guided us when we lost our hopes or beliefs, to find the correct path. However, we plugged our ears. Whereas, your father warned us many times, such as Nutuk, Atatürk's Address to the Turkish Youth, and many more. He said, don't lose your hopes. But we did.

This year which is your centennial birthday, I realized that if the people who want you give up, everything is going worse. If the people who believe in science give up, everything is going worse. If the people who produce give up, everything is going worse. Because you were entrusted to us. To stop getting worse, we should take matters into our own hands without losing our hopes and beliefs.

You are young; you are just 100 years old. There is a long journey for you, but we leave you alone sometimes. I do not want you to forgive me. Just believe and trust that we will protect you with the last things that we have, love in our hearts, and noble blood in our veins. Our duty will be to protect and educate the next generation who will raise and glorify you.

Our duty has just begun. We took over you from our ancestors and will carry you over the contemporary civilizations with your father's vision and guidance. He believed in us more than we believed in ourselves. We will do our best not to embarrass them this time. This time, we will use the torch of the science, we will produce, and we will honor you, your father, and his comrades-in-arms.

Last but not least, we won't forget these days. We won't let them forget. Their actions, their betrayal, etc. They must know this. One day they will turn to dust, but the Turkish Republic will stand forever.
