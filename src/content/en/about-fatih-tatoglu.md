# About Me

![Fatih Tatoğlu](../assets/images/fatih_tatoglu.webp "Fatih Tatoğlu")

Hello, I'm **Fatih Tatoğlu**.

I'm an engineer who's been in the technology sector for about **20 years**, a lifelong learner, and a dad.

I've never considered myself an "expert" or a "senior engineer"; I've always been someone who continues to learn, delving deeper as curiosity takes hold. In fact, that's precisely why I created this blog: **to share what I've learned and grow along the way.**

## What Do I Do?

Over the years, I've developed software, designed architectures, managed teams, solved problems, and streamlined processes.

But my favorite thing remains the same:  **understanding something complex and making it simple and understandable.**

Cloud architectures, serverless structures, POS integrations, LLM pipelines, operations management, distributed systems...

I've touched on many areas, but the common thread I've learned from all of them is this:

> "The more you know, the more you realize how much you *don't* know."

That's why I still get excited, still research, and still feel that same sense of wonder as I did on day one.

## The Human Side of Work

I've spent years working with large teams, leading them, and mentoring others.

I genuinely enjoy creating and growing together with people.

The development of a teammate, overcoming their mistakes, finding their own path – it's just as valuable to me as designing an architecture I wrote.

One of the most important things I've learned in my career is this:  **No matter how powerful the technology, no system truly works without good communication.**

## My AI and Productivity Journey

In recent years, artificial intelligence has become more than "just another technology" for me; it's **a tool that has completely transformed how I learn and create.**

LLM-based solutions, training pipelines, automation workflows, content creation systems...
I'm experimenting with them all with curiosity, learning, breaking them, and fixing them.

Most of what I share isn't meant to say "look how I do it," but rather **"This is how I tried it; maybe it will give you some ideas."**

## Life as a Dad

The role I'm most proud of in life isn't engineering; it's being a dad.

I design wooden toys for my daughter, draw 3D models, and create Montessori-inspired games.

Sometimes we go into the kitchen together to try recipes; sometimes we design a toy and experiment through trial and error.

The lessons I learn in these processes teach me far more than what I share on this blog: patience, production, repetition, experimentation, perseverance.

Perhaps the most accurate sentence would be:

> **"Being a dad is a much more human version of engineering."**

## Why This Blog Exists?

This blog has no grand ambitions.

It wasn't created to make big claims or put on a career showcase.

Instead, it's simply for:

- not forgetting what I've learned,
- leaving notes for myself,
- being useful if it helps even one person,
- seeing a trace of a journey when I look back years from now.

If even one post makes someone's job easier or inspires them in some small way, that's more than enough for me.

## In Short...

I am someone who ;

- has been immersed in technology for 20+ years,
- never stops learning,
- loves to simplify and explain what they know,
- experiments with recipes,
- doesn't hide their mistakes,
- loves to share,
- loves the sea and nature,
- A scuba diver,
- A curious engineer and dad.

And I'm continuing to share all of this journey right here on this blog.
